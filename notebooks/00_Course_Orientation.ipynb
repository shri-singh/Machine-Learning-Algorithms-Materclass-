    "### Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`random_state=42`** is used wherever randomness is involved (train/test splits, model initialization, etc.) so that you can reproduce results exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most examples use **synthetic datasets** generated with `sklearn.datasets.make_*` functions or small, well-known datasets (Iris, Boston, etc.). This keeps the focus on the algorithm rather than data wrangling.\n",
    "- Larger or real-world datasets live in the `data/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reusable Utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common helper functions (e.g., custom plot functions, data loaders, evaluation helpers) are stored in the **`src/`** directory.\n",
    "- You can import them in any notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys, os\n",
    "sys.path.append(os.path.join(\"..\", \"src\"))\n",
    "from utils import plot_decision_boundary\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebook files are prefixed with their module code (e.g., `ML200_01_Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb`).\n",
    "- Variables follow Python naming conventions: `snake_case` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for classes."
